# Default RPC Handler

The `DefaultRpcHandler` class in Stellar's Soroban environment is designed for direct interactions with the Soroban RPC server. It's the default handler used for RPC functions when no custom handler is provided. This class handles key operations like retrieving transaction information, simulating and preparing transactions, and submitting them to the network. Its default usage ensures a standard, efficient way to communicate with the Soroban server, crucial for transaction management in Stellar's Soroban smart contracts framework.
