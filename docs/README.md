# Welcome

## Stellar-Plus

stellar-plus is an all-in-one Javascript library for building and interacting with the Stellar network. It bundles the main resources from the community into an easy-to-use set of tools and capabilities.

It provides:

* **Account**: Handlers to create, load, and interact with stellar accounts, managing signatures and automatically integrating with **Freighter Wallet** for web applications.
* **Asset**: Classic token handlers follow the standard token interface for triggering different asset capabilities as well as a suite of additional features for asset management and usage.
* **Core**: Key engines for managing the different pipelines for building, submitting, and processing both Classic and Soroban transactions. These engines can be extended into your own tooling or used out-of-the-box with minimal configuration.
* **Contracts**: Default contract client implementations for selected dApp use cases.
* **RPC**: Handlers for connecting and using different RPC solutions, including a ready-to-use integration with **Validation Cloud's RPC API**.
